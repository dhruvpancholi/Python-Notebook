<p>Your Mission is to control the resistanceof the segments, so that the connectedbubbles are relatively farther and facilitating the thread to turn red.</p>
<p>The four buttons provided in each loop can be used to control the resistance, Uper 2 to increase the resistance and lower 2 to decrease the resistance.</p>
<p>Cutting the thread would add 5 points to your score and you will be provided with 3 lives.</p>
<p>Warning: Bubbles can reconnect if they comes closer.</p>
<p><center>Have Fun!!</center></p>
